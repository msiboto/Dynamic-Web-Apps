### Level | No level

### **Start Course**


In Part 1 of this course, **Structuring JavaScript**, we teach students how to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code in JavaScript. The content covers various areas of JavaScript development, including code style, documentation, error handling, abstraction, object-oriented programming, functional programming, and state machines, teaching students the skills and knowledge they need to structure their code in a way that makes it easy to manage and maintain.

### Structuring JavaScript Learning objectives:
- Understand strategies for managing complexity and structuring code to make it more maintainable.
- Learn about the origins of JavaScript and how the language is standardised and developed further.
- Understand the value of documentation and how different kinds of documentation are used in a project. 
- Understand how a consistent code style makes code easier to read and maintain and discover tools for efficiently implementing these conventions.
- Learn how to generate errors in your JavaScript to make your code more maintainable and expandable.
- Develop an understanding of how abstraction highlights the crucial features of code to developers while hiding the details.
- Understand the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and how it contributes to code modularity and maintainability.
- Learn the principles of encapsulation and how to write more secure code.
- Understand the principles of polymorphism and inheritance and how to use them to share code between related object classes.
- Develop an understanding of functional programming concepts, including purity and immutability, and how to use higher-order functions to transform data.
- Learn how to create state machines to model complex systems.
- Practice writing clean code through hands-on coding exercises and examples.

In Part 2 of this course, **JavaScript Frameworks**, we cover a range of popular JavaScript frameworks and tools for building modern web applications. The content covers everything from the most common frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue to newer, more lightweight alternatives like Alpine and Svelte. Students will learn to use these frameworks to build scalable, testable, high-performing applications.

### JavaScript Frameworks Learning Objectives:
- Understand what JavaScript frameworks are and how they can help you build web applications more efficiently.
- Learn about the elements you'll typically encounter when developing code with frameworks.
- Gain an understanding of Alpine and why it's used to build small-scale applications.
- Learn the principles and benefits of Web Components and how to use them to build scalable applications.
- Understand how Node.js and NPM effectively manage packages and dependencies in web applications.
- Learn the principles of test-driven development (TDD) and how to use tests to ensure the quality of your code.
- Understand how modern user interfaces are built in the front-end Svelte framework.
- Learn the principles and benefits of Vue.js that make it a popular choice among front-end developers.
- Understand the principles of Angular and how to use its features to build complex applications.
- Learn the principles and benefits of React and how to use its components to build dynamic UIs.
- Understand the principles of concurrency and asynchrony in JavaScript and how they can be used to improve application performance.
- Understand how to enable your web app to use RESTful API endpoints to access and manipulate data across the internet.
- Practice building web applications using various JavaScript frameworks through hands-on coding exercises and examples.

### By the end of the course, students will:
- be able to write JavaScript code that is modular, maintainable, and scalable, and they will have the skills to tackle complex coding challenges with confidence. 
- have gained the knowledge and skills to use popular JavaScript frameworks and tools to build scalable, maintainable, high-performing web applications. 
- will be able to analyse and compare different frameworks to determine the best fit for their needs and apply test-driven development practices to ensure the quality of their code.

# DWA_Part 2 Expectations

Part 2 of this course, **JavaScript Frameworks**, will primarily focus on React.js due to its popularity and employability, but the ever-changing JavaScript landscape necessitates adaptability and understanding of the broader ecosystem. While honing React skills, comparisons to other frameworks will help deepen understanding and encourage exploration.
 

A strong foundation in programming concepts is crucial for a successful career in software development.
 

**PLEASE NOTE** : To complete the DWA course successfully, you are required to:

- Watch all pre-recorded lectures
- Thoroughly work through all resources and
- Complete the SCRIMBA React Tutorial: Learn React JS
